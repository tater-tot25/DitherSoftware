# DitherSoftware
This is a python program to posterize and dither images given a custom dither pattern. There is also a sobel filter included. My goal is to eventually make a GUI!!!

To use, put the image you would like to dither in the MAIN directory. Change the file name to the name of the image, including the extension in the python script. Set the dither pattern to either wave, floyd, or atkinson (You can also add a pattern of your choice). Set the colors in the script to your prefered color palette. Finally set the sobel outline color (edgeColor), along with the threshold, the higher, the fewer outlines. Run the script and the file should be in the output folder!
